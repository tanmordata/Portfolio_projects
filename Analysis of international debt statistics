The following project uses information collectedm from the World Bank about amount of debt in USD owed by different countries. 
# 1: Find the number of distinct countries 
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries 
FROM international_debt;

#2: Find the distinct debt indicators, which describe areas a country is indebted to.
SELECT DISTINCT indicator_code AS distinct_debt_indicators 
FROM international_debt 
ORDER BY distinct_debt_indicators;

#3: Find the total amount of debt in USD owed by different countries
SELECT SUM (debt)
ROUND(debt/1000000, 2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt;

#4: Find the country owing the highest debt
SELECT country_name, 
SUM(debt) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC 
LIMIT 1;

#5: Determine the average amount of debt owed across categories
SELECT DISTINCT indicator_code AS debt_indicator, indicator_name, AVG(debt) AS average_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY debt_indicator,indicator_name
ORDER BY average_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;

#6: Find the country with the highest amount of principal repayments
SELECT country_name, indicator_name
FROM international_debt
WHERE debt = (SELECT MAX(debt)
             FROM international_debt
             WHERE indicator_code = 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD');
             
#7: Find out the debt indicator appearing most frequently 
SELECT indicator_code, COUNT(indicator_code) AS indicator_count
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY indicator_code
ORDER BY indicator_count DESC, indicator_code DESC
LIMIT 20;

#8: Find the maximum amount of debt each country owes 
SELECT country_name, MAX(debt) AS maximum_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY maximum_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;
